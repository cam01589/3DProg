I am going to work on getting multiple textures loaded, this is now working using texture arrays.

Work provided by Andy - Next, try drawing 2D "HUD" and "MENU" objects.
 
I would suggest looking into ORTHOGRAPHIC perspective and drawing your scene in two stages. First, draw your perspective objects (3D shapes), THEN draw your HUD/MENU objects.
