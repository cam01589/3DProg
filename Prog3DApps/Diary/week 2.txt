Week 2

Using 1st computer opposite projector, facing door.
connected to ps3 devkit 6

Multiple crashes on this computer.

Some of the directx tutorials would not run.

Direct3D is throwing an error, saying DXSDK is out of date.
Tried to reinstall but reinstall keeps failing
need to bring this up with service desk.


Just looked through my bookmarks and have remembered that I have a premium account with 
directxtutorial.com and will have a look at the tutorials for direct3d11.

Has been recommended by Andy that I take a look at the github tutorial video, and as such will do this during the week.

I have been following the directxtutorial.com's tutorials and came across a runtime error, tried the diagnostic tools and a search online,
but what I realised is that the tutorials are using shader model 5 where as my graphics card only supports 4.1 so I have changed this im my code ( aware that this may cause problems in later tutorials. )

GPU-Z
www.techpowerup.com/gpuz is a utility which can be used to give details of your graphics hardware ( I used this to check my support for shader model ).

The tutorials on directxtutorial.com does not have error checking so I will look for some tutorials on this.

I am currently working on instancing a pyramid.
