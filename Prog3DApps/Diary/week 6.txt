Work given to me by Andy

Be able to draw an arbitrary number of objects at random locations.

Investigate textures

and further challenge, transparancy

I have managed to get my third object working correctly, I believe I have this worked out now but will add more objects to check.
I looks as if I had settings mixed up from different tutorials, went through everything set everything again, seems to have fixed the issues I was having.

I have textures working within my program.

I have got colour blending working perfectly, but I have not yet started working on transparency.
