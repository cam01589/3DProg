Good progress made

I have both keyboard and mouse input working.

Challenges to work on from Andy are to Draw multiple different shapes - Main challenge and if I can 
Have an object "moving" across the screen and "bouncing" off the edges.
If I have extra time I am going to get my error checking working.

I have very simple collision working using checks to see if my object intersects with screen_width.

I have discovered that I have had bracket around my second objects vertices which was stopping it from being drawn so I have no idea how many of my attempts would have actually worked, so now I will have to try them all again.
