Work given to my by Andy,

Modify my code to draw two different objects using one buffer.

Try using matrices to move/rotate the two different objects to different parts of the screen.

I have completed this work.

I have managed to get sound working but the rest of my program only runs after I have quit out of the program.  I believe I could remedy this by putting the code to activate the sound within my run code section.  Will have a look at this soon.

Installed visual studio 2012, had an incompatible pdb error that stopped my work from loading, cleaning the build seemed to clear this up.

Working on my buffer again still cannot work out the numbers for vertices etc.
